\subsection{gfx::rgba}
    In GFX we represent colors in gfx::rgb, gfx::rgba.
  the value of colors are in range [0, 1] not [0, 255]. \\
  you may wonder if you can use something like hex,
  fortunatly we provide gfx::hex function which accepts
  a hex unsigned int and return rgba based on its value. \\
  NOTE: you must provide complete hex to avoid weird colors
  that can result if you didn't do so.
  for example:
    use 0xffffffff instead of 0xffffff
