\subsection{gfx::vector2 and gfx::vector3}
These are two template classes, which means they can accept may data types: int, float, etc...\\
Till now, they only supports addition and subtraction from each other. \\
It have a single member functions called gfx::vectorX::distance(), which accepts another vector 
of the same type and return the distance between them. \\
NOTE: vectors are intended to use with float especially in range [-1-1] which is screen coordinates in OpenGL by the way.
