\section{what is gfx?}
  gfx (which stands for graphics) is an abstract project for OpenGL. 
  which is intented to be used to simplify usage of OpenGL and glfw.
  These library isn't as good as something
  like SFML or SDL2 BUT It's just been made for learning purpose.

\section{about the author}
  I started learning OpenGL short time after getting into linux.
  I started with D3D9 which was a bit old. but I think it was a
  good experience to have.

\section{who is this book for?}
  anyone with c++ intermediate experience who wants to learn graphics programming.
  it's worth noting that this is NOT a high quality OpenGL tutorial. it just discusses
  a basic framework based on OpenGL.
