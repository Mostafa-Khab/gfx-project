# Graphics(gfx) project 
## OpenGL based framework (using GLFW)
 This is a pretty old OpenGL based framework (as it uses version 2.1 features only) however you can modify it and add what you need.
## NOTE:-
 You can specify what version of OpenGL to use in the Context Constructor.
 But consider to use your own version of shaders and not so old as in this project
## HELP:-
 if you want to do some kind of review. start with the system folder as it has stuff that is less related to OpenGL.
 in the graphics folder there is files that have classes related more to OpenGL and GLFW.
## Creating similar project?
 if you are interested in making a similar project from scratch, you can study this project.
### start with system:-
 1. vectors
 2. colors
 3. clock
 4. debug
 5. callbacks
### then go to graphics:-
 1. context
 2. shaders
 3. program
 4. buffer
 5. polygon
 6. view
### these classes consist of more than one file (hpp + cpp) with -std=c++17 at least (for compiling)
