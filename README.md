# Graphics(gfx) project 
## OpenGL based framework (using GLFW)
#### This is a pretty old OpenGL based framework (as it uses version 2.1 features only) however you can modify andadd what you need.
## NOTE:-
#### You can specify what version of OpenGL to use in the Context Constructor.
### HELP:-
##### if you want to do someking of review. start with th e system folder as it has stuff that is less related to OpenGL.
##### in the graphics folder there is files that have classes related more to OpenGL and GLFW.
